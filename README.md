# iocspector
IoCSpector is a basic platform that will scan OTRS updated ticket articles for IPv4 addresses, gather reputation data, and update the ticket with their results. Created for a Master's of Science Capstone project.

My first actual project design that is published to GitHub. This will be a continual work in progress to become a fully-fledged SOAR platform integrating with multiple ticketing systems.
